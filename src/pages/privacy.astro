          <p>
            When you sign in with Google, we rely on Google OAuth to authenticate your identity. As part of this process,
            we may receive information such as your Google account email address and basic profile information that
            Google shares with us.

            </li>
            <li>
              We will update this Privacy Policy and, where required, seek your consent before using Google user data in

            <li>
              <strong>Service providers and infrastructure partners</strong> that help us operate the site
              (for example, authentication, database hosting, and future payment processing).
            </li>
            <li>
