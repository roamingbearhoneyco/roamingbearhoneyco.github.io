            <p>Roaming Bear Honey Co. started with a simple truth: when you slow down enough to truly <em>listen</em> to the hum of a hive, something in you shifts.</p>
            <p>We believe great honey doesn't begin in the jar—it begins in the soil, the weather, the temperament of a queen, and the patience of a keeper.</p>
            <p>Every jar we offer reflects what we've observed, tended, and protected. This isn't a race to scale—it's a commitment to resilience, transparency, and emotional resonance.</p>
            <p>But we're not doing this alone.</p>

            <p>Through our <strong>Friends of the Bear</strong> initiative, we invite others into the story—via hive adoption, collaborative publishing, and sharing small-batch harvests.</p>
            <p>We showcase their honey. Their practices. Their stories.</p>
            <p>Roaming Bear isn't just about honey. It's about protecting the dignity of small-scale care and giving keepers space to be heard.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Roaming Bear.</p>

              Every jar supports sustainable beekeeping and promotes biodiversity in our ecosystems. Taste the difference in every drop.
