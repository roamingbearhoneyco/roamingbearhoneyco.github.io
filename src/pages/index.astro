      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <p>
          Roaming Bear Honey Co. started with a simple truth: when you slow down enough to truly <em>listen</em> to the hum of a hive, something in you shifts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We believe great honey doesn’t begin in the jar—it begins in the soil, the weather, the temperament of a queen, and the patience of a keeper. We honor those things. We move at their pace. And in doing so, we craft honey that carries the weight of place.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Every jar we offer reflects what we’ve observed, tended, and protected. This isn’t a race to scale—it’s a commitment to resilience, transparency, and emotional resonance. From the foothills of Virginia to a porch in Montana, Roaming Bear is grounded in care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But we’re not doing this alone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Through our <strong>Friends of the Bear</strong> initiative, we’re inviting others into the story. Whether through hive adoption, collaborative publishing, or offering small-batch harvests from their own apiaries, we’re building a platform that amplifies the voices of beekeepers across the country. We showcase their honey. Their practices. Their stories.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Roaming Bear isn’t just about honey. It’s about protecting the dignity of small-scale care. About giving keepers a space to be heard and a way to thrive. We’re building tools that empower others while keeping brand soul in the founder’s hands—systems that scale with intention and stories that stick.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you’re here, you’re already part of that movement.
          <br>
          <strong>Welcome to Roaming Bear.</strong>
        </p>

          Every jar supports sustainable beekeeping and promotes biodiversity in our ecosystems. Taste the difference in every drop.
